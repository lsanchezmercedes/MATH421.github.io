# Objective of the Study 
### - To Understand The Composition of Of Color Patients within Providers
### - To Understand The Characteristics That Make Up This Population
### - To Understand The Reasoning of Visits by These Patients

# Subjects of the Study
## - Data from three Rhode Island specialty hospitals, Bradley, Butler, and Rehabilitation includes features such as Age, Sex, Race, Providers, Service, etc.
### - This data was segmented for year of discharge of 2018 and Race feature had unknowns and blank removed for the sake of the analysis

# Predictive Modelling 
## Two models were ran under this data.....
#### Model 1: Predictive if patient will have low/high total cost based on median
#### Model 2: Predictive if patient of color based on same characteristics

# Errors and Challenges
### 1. Error from Graphing
### 2. Training the Models
### 3. Prepping the Data
